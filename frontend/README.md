# Cubit — Frontend Starter (Designer-focused)

This is a scaffolded frontend starter intended as a modern, designer-friendly UI for the Cubit project.

Features:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with CSS variables (design tokens)
- Framer Motion for smooth micro-interactions
- Minimal component set (Header, Sidebar, Card, Button)
- Storybook skeleton for component previews

Quickstart:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. npm run storybook

Next steps I can help with:
- Open a PR adding these files to DoctorDoveDragon/Cubit
- Expand Storybook with component variants and tokens
- Add Figma tokens export or Style Dictionary sync
- Add authentication flow and API integration

To create a PR with these files, say: "open a PR"
