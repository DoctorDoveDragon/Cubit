# Prior-Art Search Plan — Cubit Invention Concepts

Purpose: Provide focused search queries, target resources, and evaluation criteria for a preliminary prior-art reconnaissance. This is not a substitute for a professional patentability search but will help identify obvious hits early.

Target Concepts / Keywords
- "visual to code" mapping
- "diagram to code" generator
- "shape to code" conversion
- "visual programming" + "deterministic"
- "canonical serialization" + "SVG" + "provenance"
- "headless export" + "SVG" + "automation" + "puppeteer"
- "teaching" + "geometry" + "code generation"

Search Sources
- Google Patents (https://patents.google.com) — primary for patent literature
- USPTO search (https://patft.uspto.gov) — for U.S. patents
- Google Scholar / IEEE Xplore / ACM Digital Library — for academic papers
- arXiv — preprints
- Product searches (Google, Bing) for commercial systems (e.g., Blockly, Scratch derivatives, diagram-to-code tools)

Example Boolean Queries
- "diagram to code" OR "visual to code" OR "diagram to program"
- "canonical" AND "serialization" AND (SVG OR "vector export")
- "visual programming" AND (deterministic OR reproducible OR canonical)
- (shape OR geometry OR grid) AND (mapping OR "code generation")

Evaluation Criteria
- Is there a specific module or method that performs deterministic canonicalization and mapping to an AST? If yes, compare steps and data structures.
- Does the prior art disclose a headless extraction pipeline that triggers an in-page export and saves timestamped vectors for legal filing? If yes, note differences in automation handshake, metadata, or packaging.
- Does any prior art combine pedagogical mapping (shape→concept) with deterministic code export and provenance metadata?

Deliverables I can produce
- A short results spreadsheet (CSV) listing candidate patents/papers, URL, short summary (1–2 lines), and reason for relevance.
- A hit/no-hit recommendation for each claim concept to help prioritize attorney review.

If you want, I can run an initial automated search on Google Patents and arXiv and produce the CSV. This will only be a preliminary recon and not a formal clearance search.
